# Contributing

Thanks for wanting to contribute to Chithi! This page outlines the basic workflow.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-change`
2. Add tests for new functionality and run the test suite: `pytest`
3. Keep commits small and focused; use clear messages.
4. Open a Pull Request and describe the change and how to test it.

## Code style and checks

- Run linters and type-checkers before opening a PR (e.g., `ruff`, `mypy`, and `black` if included).
- CI may run tests and linters automatically; fix failures before requesting review.

## Issues & Questions

Open an issue if you're unsure where to start or if you need help reproducing a bug.
